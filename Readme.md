# Project Name
Project 1 for MSCH-220 at Indiana University
9/5/2023
A simple interactive fiction game with an original story

## Implementation
The story was written in Twine 2.7 and exported as a JSON file. 
The game engine was implemented in Python 3.10


## What Makes this a Game?
This game has a compelling structure in which the player attempts to survive to the best of their ability and "win", navigating through different choices and places. This behavior is somewhat consistent with the autonomy, competence, and relatedness dimensions of Self Determination theory.

## Future Development
I will continue working on game to add more features, passages, and texts. I hope to eventually release a version of this game publicly with art and sound.
